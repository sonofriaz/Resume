        <p>Hello, I'm <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sonofriaz_2001/" target="_blank"">Ammar Riaz.</a></p>

        <p>
          a 23-year-old software engineering enthusiast. I completed my course
          at <a href="https://aptech-education.com.pk/" target="_blank">Aptech Computer Education,</a>
          <br>
          where I gained a strong foundation in
          various programming languages and software development concepts.For
          the past four years, I have been working at <a href="https://www.pakrail.gov.pk/" target="_blank">Pakistan Railways</a> as a
          Junior Assistant Train,<br> where I have gained valuable experience in
          administrative tasks and team collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
            After my appointment at <a href="https://www.pakrail.gov.pk/" target="_blank">Pakistan Railways</a>, I had a one-year gap in the coding field,
            which resulted in a significant deterioration of my coding concepts. However, I am currently working on improving my skills and knowledge in coding.
            <br>
            <br>
            Recently, my passion for coding has been reignited,
            and I am eagerly waiting to enhance my expertise in this field.I firmly believe that continuous learning and adaptation are crucial in the rapidly evolving world of technology. 
             I am prepared to embark on a coding journey to further develop my skills and make them more proficient.If you are searching for a diligent and composed individual with a strong foundation in software engineering and a 
           renewed enthusiasm for coding, I kindly request you to provide me with an opportunity to showcase my abilities.
